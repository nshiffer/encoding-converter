This is a placeholder for the Open Graph image.

To create the final image:
1. Open the SVG version (og-image.svg) in a browser or image editor
2. The SVG now references your converter_logo.png file
3. Export/save as PNG with dimensions 1200x630 pixels
4. Replace this file with the exported PNG version for optimal social media sharing

Note: If the SVG doesn't display your logo properly when opened directly, you may need to:
- Create the PNG in another tool using the logo and text layout
- Or modify the SVG to use a base64 encoded version of your logo
